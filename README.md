# Introduction
Welcome to the Bot Revolution repository! Lately I got interested in the field of Large Language Models and conversational tech but the field is moving so fast that keeping a track of things has been becoming difficult for me. So, I thought of compiling a list of interesting conversational tech that I come across.

Here, I have compiled a list of some of the chatbots that are doing rounds in the discussions in twitter and elsewhere. The idea is to add more items to this list and grow this to be a comprehensive collection which anyone can refer.

I hope that this collection is informative and I encourage everyone to contribute to this repository by suggesting new chatbots or research papers to be included in the list.
